# My Obsidian Setup Guide
## Overview
I have been getting quite a bit of people reaching out, asking how to replicate my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) setup. I figured I would make a quick guide on how to do it.

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Install Obsidian and Create a Vault
First things first, you need to install Obsidian. You can download it [here](https://obsidian.md). Once you have it installed, create a new vault. This is where all of your notes will be stored.

### Step 2. Install the Cupertino Theme
The Cupertino theme is a theme that I have been using for a while now. It is a clean, minimalistic theme that is easy on the eyes. To install it, follow these steps:
1. Go to `Settings` -> `Appearance` -> `Themes` and click on `Manage`.
2. Search for `Cupertino` and click on `Install & User`.

### Step 3: Install the Community Plugins
**Note**: I have included a folder in the project called `04 Plugins` that contains all the plugins that I use. You can download them from there but they may be out of date. I would reccomend downloading them from the community store in Obsidian or from their GitHub Repos that are linked.

In Obsidian, go to `Settings` -> `Community plugins` and install the following plugins:
#### 1. Autofit Tabs
